RxUI Design Guidelines
======================

A set of practices to help maintain sanity when building an RxUI client 
application distilled from hard lessons learned.

## Resources  
* [Read the docs](http://reactiveui.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) 
  * Has good documentation on everything they have gotten to... unfortunatly they have not gotten to everything.
* [Read the source](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI)
  * Aside from actually reading the code, often there will be some good information in the comments.
* [Interactive diagrams of Rx Observables](http://rxmarbles.com/) 
  * A visual and interactive way to learn observable operations (merge, concat, zip)

## Best Practices

The following recommendations are intended to help keep ReactiveUI code 
predictable, understandable, and fast.

They are, however, only guidelines. Use best judgment when determining whether 
to apply the recommendations here to a given piece of code.

### Commands

Prefer binding user interactions to commands rather than methods.

__Do__

```csharp
// In XAML
<Button Command="{Binding Delete}" .../>

public class RepositoryViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
  public RepositoryViewModel() 
  {
    Delete = ReactiveCommand.CreateAsyncObservable(x => DeleteImpl());
    Delete.ThrownExceptions.Subscribe(ex => /*...*/);
  }

  public ReactiveAsyncCommand Delete { get; private set; }

  public IObservable<Unit> DeleteImpl() {...}
}
```

__Don't__

Use the Caliburn.Micro conventions for associating buttons and commands:

```csharp
// In XAML
<Button x:Name="Delete" .../>

public class RepositoryViewModel : PropertyChangedBase
{
  public void Delete() {...}	
}
```

Why? 

1. ReactiveCommand exposes the `CanExecute` property of the command to 
enable applications to introduce additional behaviour.
2. It handles marshaling the result back to the UI thread.
3. It tracks in-flight items.

#### Don't invoke commands in ViewModel Constructors  
__Do__
```csharp
// ViewModel Constructor
public ViewModel()
{
    PerformSearchCommand = ReactiveCommand.CreateAsyncTask([...]);
}

// View Constructor
public View()
{
    this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.ViewModel)
        .InvokeCommand(this, x => x.ViewModel.PerformSearchCommand);
}
```
__Don't__
```csharp
public ViewModel()
{
    PerformSearchCommand = ReactiveCommand.CreateAsyncTask([...]);
    PerformSearchCommand.Execute(null); // begin executing immediately
}
```
Why?  
When testing the ViewModel you will need to be able to test the before and after command execution state.

#### Asynchronous Commands

Prefer using async `ReactiveCommand`'s over the more basic `ReactiveCommand` for all but the most simple tasks. In ReactiveUI, you should never put Interestingâ„¢ code inside the Subscribe block - Subscribe is solely to log the result of operations, or to wire up properties to other properties.

__Do__

```csharp
// In XAML
<Button Command="{Binding Delete}" .../>

public class RepositoryViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
  public RepositoryViewModel() 
  {
    Delete = ReactiveCommand.CreateAsyncObservable(x => DeleteImpl());
    Delete.IsExecuting.ToProperty(this, x => x.IsDeleting, out _isDeleting);
    Delete.ThrownExceptions.Subscribe(ex => this.Log().ErrorException("Something went wrong", ex));
  }

  public ReactiveCommand<Unit> Delete { get; private set; }
  
  readonly ObservableAsPropertyHelper<bool> _isDeleting;
  public bool IsDeleting { get { return _isDeleting.Value; } }

  public IObservable<Unit> DeleteImpl()
  {
    return Observable.Start(() => /* ... */);
  }
}
```

__Don't__

```csharp
// In XAML
<Button Command="{Binding Delete}" .../>

public class RepositoryViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
  public RepositoryViewModel() 
  {
    Delete = ReactiveCommand.Create();
    // This will block the UI thread while DeleteImpl runs
    Delete.Subscribe(async _ => await DeleteImpl());
    // These will not do what you expect
    Delete.IsExecuting.ToProperty(this, x => x.IsDeleting, out _isDeleting);
    Delete.ThrownExceptions.Subscribe(ex => this.Log().ErrorException("Something went wrong", ex));
  }

  public ReactiveCommand<object> Delete { get; private set; }
  
  readonly ObservableAsPropertyHelper<bool> _isDeleting;
  public bool IsDeleting { get { return _isDeleting.Value; } }

  public IObservable<Unit> DeleteImpl()
  {
    return Observable.Start(() => /* ... */);
  }
}
```

#### Why

A lot of the power of `ReactiveCommand` comes from the async version. In the basic version the following features do not function as expected:

* `IsExecuting` observable will not report on your asynchronous method when it is inside the `Subscribe`
* `ThrownExceptions` will not catch anything.
* `CanExecute` is not affected if the command is currently executing, leading to the possibilty of multiple execution at the same time.

#### Command Names

Don't suffix `ReactiveCommand` properties' names with `Command`; instead, name the property using a verb that describes the command's action. For example:

```csharp
	
public ReactiveCommand Synchronize { get; private set; }

// and then in the ctor:

Synchronize = ReactiveCommand.CreateAsyncObservable(
  _ => SynchronizeImpl(mergeInsteadOfRebase: !IsAhead));

```

When a `ReactiveCommand`'s implementation is too large or too complex for an anonymous delegate, name the implementation's method the same name as the command, but with `Impl` suffixed (for example, `SychronizeImpl` above).

### UI Thread and Schedulers

Always make sure to update the UI on the `RxApp.MainThreadScheduler` to ensure UI  changes happen on the UI thread. In practice, this typically means making sure to update view models on the main thread scheduler.

__Do__

```csharp
FetchStuffAsync()
  .ObserveOn(RxApp.MainThreadScheduler)
  .Subscribe(x => this.SomeViewModelProperty = x);
```
__Don't__

```csharp
FetchStuffAsync()
  .Subscribe(x => this.SomeViewModelProperty = x);
```

Even better, pass the scheduler to the asynchronous operation - this is often
necessary for more complex tasks.

__Better__

```csharp
FetchStuffAsync(RxApp.MainThreadScheduler)
  .Subscribe(x => this.SomeViewModelProperty = x);
```

#### Pass ReactiveUI Schedulers  
Make sure to pass one of the ReactiveUI schedulers (`RxApp.MainThreadScheduler` or `RxApp.TaskPoolScheduler`) to ReativeExtensions methods that accept one (`.Throttle` and `.Sample`).  

Why?  
You will be able to use ReactiveUI's `TestScheduler` in your unit tests

### Prefer Observable Property Helpers to setting properties explicitly

When a property's value depends on another property, a set of properties, or an 
observable stream, rather than set the value explicitly, use 
`ObservableAsPropertyHelper` with `WhenAny` wherever possible.

__Do__

```csharp
public class RepositoryViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
  public RepositoryViewModel()
  {
    canDoIt = this.WhenAny(x => x.StuffFetched, y => y.OtherStuffNotBusy, (x, y) => x && y)
      .ToProperty(this, x => x.CanDoIt);
  }

  readonly ObservableAsPropertyHelper<bool> canDoIt;
  public bool CanDoIt
  {
    get { return canDoIt.Value; }  
  }	
}
```

__Don't__

```csharp
this.WhenAny(x => x.StuffFetched, y => y.OtherStuffNotBusy, (x, y) => x && y)
  .ObserveOn(RxApp.MainThreadScheduler)
  .Subscribe(x => CanDoIt = x);
```

#### Why?

 - `ObservableAsPropertyHelper` will take care of raising `INotifyPropertyChanged`
   events - if you're creating read-only properties, this can save so much boilerplate
   code.
 - `ObservableAsPropertyHelper` will use `MainThreadScheduler` to schedule subscribers,
  unless specified otherwise - no need to remember to do this yourself.
 - `WhenAny` lets you combine multiple properties, treat their changes as observable
  streams, and craft ViewModel-specific outputs.

### Almost always use `this` as the left hand side of a `WhenAny` call.

__Do__

```csharp
public class MyViewModel
{
  public MyViewModel(IDependency dependency)
  {
    Ensure.ArgumentNotNull(dependency, "dependency");

    this.Dependency = dependency;

    this.stuff = this.WhenAny(x => x.Dependency.Stuff, x => x.Value)
      .ToProperty(this, x => x.Stuff);
  }

  public IDependency Dependency { get; private set; }

  readonly ObservableAsPropertyHelper<IStuff> stuff;
  public IStuff Stuff
  {
    get { return this.stuff.Value; }
  }
}
```

__Don't__

```csharp
public class MyViewModel(IDependency dependency)
{
  stuff = dependency.WhenAny(x => x.Stuff, x => x.Value)
    .ToProperty(this, x => x.Stuff);
}
```

#### Why?

 - the lifetime of `dependency` is unknown - if it is a singleton it
 could introduce memory leaks into your application

### Use descriptive variables in your `WhenAny`s

In situations where you are detecting changes in multiple expressions, ensure you name the variables in the `selector` 

```csharp
public class MyViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
  public MyViewModel()
  {
    this.WhenAny(
        x => x.SomeProperty.IsEnabled,
        x => x.SomeProperty.IsLoading,
        (isEnabled, isLoading) => isEnabled.Value && isLoading.Value)
        .Subscribe(_ => DoSomething());
  }
  
  // other code here
}
```

__Don't__

```csharp
public class MyViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
  public MyViewModel()
  {
    this.WhenAny(
        x => x.SomeProperty.IsEnabled,
        x => x.SomeProperty.IsLoading,
        (x, y) => x.Value && y.Value)
        .Subscribe(_ => DoSomething());
  }
  
  // other code here
}
```

#### Why?

This helps greatly with the readability of complex expressions, particularly when working with boolean values.


### ReactiveLists
Prefer initalizing the list only once (in the constructor) and modifying the contents of that list rather than replacing it.

__Do__
```csharp
public ViewModel()
{
    Versions = new ReactiveList<SheetViewModel>();
    
    ReactiveCommand<SheetViewModel> UpdateVersions = ReactiveCommand.CreateAsyncTask(UpdateVersionsImpl);
    UpdateVersions
      .Subscribe(versions =>
        {
          Versions.AddRange(versions);
        });
}
```

__Don't__
```csharp
public ViewModel()
{
    ReactiveCommand<SheetViewModel> UpdateVersions = ReactiveCommand.CreateAsyncTask(UpdateVersionsImpl);
    UpdateVersions.Select(x => new ReactiveList(x)).ToProperty(this, x => Versions); 
}
```

Why?
You are probably using a ReactiveList because you care about the contents of the list ... Your life will be easier if you don't have to check if the ReactiveList changed to a new ReactiveList (e.g. `this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.MyList)`) AND the thing you actually care about happened (e.g. `MyList.ItemsAdded`). Also, when the ReactiveList changes it will be hard/impossible to derive if any of the changes you care about have also happened (Changed, ItemsAdded, ItemsRemoved, etc).
